# TheBestList Shared Blocklist Files

This is the only good blocklist. In fact, I think it's the best. I call it TheBestList.

Instead of trusting an algorithm with your data, I hand-crafted this CSV out of the forges of [nodes.fediverse.party](https://nodes.fediverse.party/). This will effectively remove all racism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, ageism, casteism, or religious activity from your timelines. Enjoy!

(You shouldn't actually use this, it's a joke. This effectively blocks *everyone* on the Fediverse for you. This is not meant to dissuade you from using blocklists, it's just a bit.)
